# Potentially Redundant or Unused Files and Folders

This document lists files and folders that appear to be redundant, unused, or could be consolidated. Review these items to determine if they can be safely removed or refactored.

## Files for Review

- `.DS_Store` (multiple instances): macOS specific files. These should generally be ignored by version control and are not needed for the project itself.
- `new-version.html`: This file name suggests it might be an old or alternative version of another page (e.g., `index.html` or `project.html`).
- `assets/Mahiru in casual outfit.png`, `assets/Mahiru in casual outfit2.png`, `assets/Mahiru in casual outfit3.png`, `assets/mahiru_full_body.png`, `assets/mahiru.png`: Multiple images of "Mahiru". It's possible some are duplicates, older versions, or not all are actively used.
- `assets/my_image.jpg`, `assets/my_image1.jpg`, `assets/my-image.jpg`: Similar to the "Mahiru" images, these appear to be variations of a personal image.
- `assets/logo_puzzle.png`, `assets/logo_puzzle0.png`: `logo_puzzle0.png` might be an older version of `logo_puzzle.png`.
- `assets/icons/java.webp`, `assets/icons/java1.png`: These could be redundant if `assets/icons/java.png` is the primary Java icon used.
- `assets/icons/js.webp`: Potentially redundant if `assets/icons/javascript.png` is used.
- `assets/omacha/Screen Recording 2024-05-16 at 00.01.07.mov`: A screen recording file. This is highly unlikely to be used in a web portfolio and should be removed.
- `assets/star/favicon.png`: There are already `assets/favicon.ico` and `assets/favicon.png` at the root of the `assets` directory. This specific favicon might be redundant or only used in a very specific context.

## Recommendations

- **Remove `.DS_Store` files:** These are system files and not part of the project's content. Ensure your `.gitignore` is configured to ignore them.
- **Consolidate images:** Review the various "Mahiru" and "my_image" files. Keep only the necessary versions and remove duplicates or unused alternatives.
- **Verify `new-version.html`:** Determine if this page is still needed. If not, remove it. If it's a work-in-progress, consider renaming it to something more descriptive or integrating its content into the main site.
- **Clean up `assets/icons/`:** Check which icon formats are actually used and remove redundant `.webp` or numbered `.png` versions.
- **Remove `assets/omacha/Screen Recording 2024-05-16 at 00.01.07.mov`:** This file is almost certainly not needed for the website.
- **Review `assets/star/favicon.png`:** Confirm if this favicon is used anywhere, or if the root `assets/favicon.png` is sufficient.
